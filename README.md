# ChargePoint
CS4084 Mobile Application Development

ChargePoint allows electric vehicle owners to find the closest available electric charger for their vehicle. Using the user’s location and GPS and the ChargePoint’s from the OpenChargeMap API, we can find the closest car charger to the user’s location. Given that a lot of people are now switching to electric cars in Ireland and the market is growing, this new application could cater to new electric car users. ChargePoint will provide the user with an estimate of how much it will cost to fill the car with electricity and users will be able to pay for power at a ChargePoint.
